    <string name="tutorial_description">You’re a synthetic biologist trying to spell out a word using a
genetic circuit. Each letter is a protein, but they’re also activators! Your goal is to spell out the five letter word you enter using the promoters given to you.
For each letter, choose a promoter activated by the letter that came before it. But be careful, don’t let a protein be expressed early, or your circuit will misspell the word!</string>
