#EC327 Semester Project

##Appication Name: Synbio Logic

##Purpose: Provide an educational platform to learn about gene expression and the logic behind genetic circuits.

##General Description: The goal of the game is to spell a word using inducible promoters. Each promoter is induced by one or more letters before it in the word. However, some promoters have additional logic (AND/OR) that causes complications. The word can be mispelled by activating a promoter too soon.

##Game Rules:
- The word must be five letters.
- The word cannot contain duplicate letters.
- The circuit must be filled to evaluate the solution.
- Promoters activated before their order in the word are incorrect.
