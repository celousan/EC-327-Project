# EC327 Semester Project

## Appication Name: Synbio Logic

## Purpose: 
Provide an educational platform to learn about gene expression and the logic behind genetic circuits. The files available in this repository can be run on Android Studio and displayed on an emulator or an Android phone.

## General Description: 
The goal of this application is to provide an interactive game for a logic puzzle designed by the STEM Pathways outreach organization at Boston University (https://www.stempathways.org/). The logic puzzle is an introduction to the mechanisms of conditional gene expression and genetic circuits. The goal of the game is to spell a word using inducible promoters. Each promoter is induced by one or more letters before it in the word. However, some promoters have additional logic (AND/OR) that causes complications. The word can be mispelled by activating a promoter too soon. The user must correctly arrange the promoters in order to reach a correct solution, of which there are several for a single word.

## Game Rules:
- The word must be five letters.
- The word cannot contain duplicate letters.
- The circuit must be filled to evaluate the solution.
- Promoters activated before their order in the word are incorrect.
